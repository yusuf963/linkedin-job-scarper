Platform Engineer (Manchester),"Description Build and maintain an IaC codebase, and be an advocate for architecting platforms using the latest best practices and industry standards. AND Introduction At AND, we accelerate the development of digital capabilities. In practice, that means helping ambitious leaders and organisations build the teams, products, processes and even operational structures they need to close the digital skills gap within their organisation today, so that they thrive tomorrow. Clients rely on our experience, agility and craft skills across tech and business strategy, software development and product management to address some of the toughest challenges facing their businesses. We bring aboard thinkers, tinkerers, passionate software craftspeople and inspiring technologists to help us solve these challenges. Together, we’re united by a sense of pragmatism, purpose and a deeply-held belief that digital products and technology alone won’t transform a business or save the world: it’s the people that count. About You As a Platform Engineer, you will be a specialist in your team, building scalable cloud solutions to solve a variety of problems. To do this, you will need to be able to: Build and maintain an IaC codebase using tools such as Terraform, Puppet and Ansible. You will also be an advocate for architecting platforms using the latest best practices and industry standards and using IaC tools to maintain standards that are inline with our clients security policies. Be comfortable discussing the business/commercial benefits of Cloud whilst being equally comfortable deep diving into AWS platform configurations such as Elastic Load Balancing, NAT tables or Route 53 for example. Evangaliese to our clients the other services provided by AWS and be able to relate them to a specific client need. Initially focussing on AWS, it’s important to be able to/demonstrate a willingness to move between the different Cloud providers, building up a wealth of knowledge over time. Be just as comfortable troubleshooting across brownfield platforms and application domains as when designing greenfield cloud platforms. Have an ability to horizon scan and evaluate new technology options and vendor products and understand how these can be used to solve our clients problems. Be an advocate of mentoring and upskilling of clients and other ANDi’s as part of day-to-day activities. To do that, it’s essential you bring the following: Previous experience in a devops or platform engineering role. Experience working in Continuous Integration or Continuous Delivery environment. A real passion for technology and desire to learn new emerging technologies. Experience using Terraform or scripting experience (e.g. Bash). Experience of configuration management tools such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet. Joining AND From the work we deliver, to the way we serve and support our people, we work hard to ensure that there’s nowhere quite like AND. But joining a company is a two-way street: the fit has to work on both sides. So before you apply, here’s three key things to understand about us: We’re built for people - like, real humans. Not ‘resources’ or ‘staff’. That means happiness and wellbeing really do matter to us, and we hate unnecessary hierarchy and bureaucracy. There’s no well-trodden path ahead: AND is growing fast and forging a new trail. That’s exciting, and gives us all the autonomy and opportunity we love - but bear in mind it also demands focus, patience and resilience. Diversity is a priority. After all, to build great products that a wide variety of different people love to use, we need a wide variety of people to help us build them. So diversity is more than a policy or a word: it’s business critical for us. Still sound good? Great!

Platform Engineer,"Platform Engineer (Data) As we are expanding our in-house Data Platform, we are looking for a talented Platform Engineer to work within the Platform team and closely with our Data Engineering. We are pushing towards having everything as infrastructure as code, using automation everywhere and adding security into every layer of the product life cycle. We are constantly refining our setup and evaluating new technologies and tools to further improve our infrastructure. We know that there are elements of our delivery pipeline that could be made more efficient. We are looking for someone who has used Terraform or CloudFormation (both is better) and can demonstrate the use of these IAC tools. Alongside building this core infrastructure for the deployment pipeline, you will deploy Serverless technologies as well as older style infrastructure like EC2 and database servers. This is a fast-paced role, and well suited for someone looking to get their hands involved in all aspects of cloud provisioning using the latest tech stack, as well as orchestration and configuration management. You will be responsible for implementing CI/CD pipelines, defining infrastructure as code patterns, service integration and contributing to the DevOps culture within the wider Platform Engineering team. What we need from you To work successfully within this role, you will need significant experience with Linux supporting a web application. Our new platform is built from the ground up using AWS Serverless technologies, we are happy to help you transition from traditional containerisation or a virtual machine stack to get you onto our new platform.

Although we do not need development experience, you should be comfortable scripting in Python and keen to improve your knowledge in this area. We're also looking for someone with a brain for networks and a love of tinkering. You should understand core networking fundamentals around TCP/UDP. Root cause analysis is critical in troubleshooting issues and ensuring our set-up is constantly improving. You must be able to give an example of an issue for which you found the root cause and how you ensured such an issue did not occur in the future. This is not an insular role. You will be working within a team, often having to communicate complex issues to someone without as much knowledge on the subject as you have. What you will get from us There will be a lot to learn! For someone who loves challenges and hates standing still, this role has plenty to offer. Our projects range from small to large but always offer variety and complexity, with plenty of support where needed. We try and get the balance right for all our roles, this one being no different. We would expect that project work will take up 80% of your time, with support work filling up the other 20%. As the role grows, the shift will be towards project work, and you can expect this type of work to be your majority focus in future. As the team around you expands, expect to take on more responsibility. There is opportunity for this role to take on leadership if that's a direction that interests you or you may prefer to specialise in a particular technology or area of our platform as your skills develop.

Platform Engineer,"Company Profile Experian is a leading global information services company that unlocks the power of data to create opportunities for consumers, businesses and societies across the world. During life’s big moments – from buying a home or car, to sending a child to college, to growing a business exponentially by connecting it with new customers – we empower consumers and our clients to manage their data with confidence so they can maximize every opportunity. We gather, analyse and process data in ways others can’t. We help individuals take financial control and access financial services, businesses make smarter decision and thrive, lenders lend more responsibly, and organizations prevent identity fraud and crime. For more than 125 years, we’ve helped consumers and clients prosper, and economies and communities flourish – and we’re not done. Our 17,000 people in 37 countries believe the possibilities for you, and our world, are growing. We’re investing in new technologies, talented people and innovation so we can help create a better tomorrow. In Decision Analytics we unlock meaning within data to help clients solve problems and drive better decisions and outcomes; is this customer who they claim to be? Can this person afford the loan they’re asking for? Does this person qualify for a service we provide? Organisations need to answer these sorts of questions hundreds, thousands, even millions of times a day. As well as answering them accurately and consistently, they need to answer them quickly because that’s what their customers expect. We help our clients do this – minimising the risk to their organisation while delivering the type of customer experience that people expect. We help them to lend effectively, to detect and minimise fraud and to comply with legal requirements. We help them identify new opportunities including more efficient ways to run their business and better ways to cross-sell their products. We do this by combining our own data with data from our clients and third parties. We then use advanced technologies to organise and analyse this data, turning it into useful, meaningful information which our customers can act on. Our clients can make lending decisions on hundreds of millions of credit applications every year and can also avoid fraud by checking that applicants are who they say they are.
