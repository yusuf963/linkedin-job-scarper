It’s the connective tissue that binds society, moves opinion, changes minds, sparks ideas and brings us together. Media is a vibrant, creative force. A powerful force. A force for good. Why, then, has the advertising industry turned ‘media’ into a dirty word: the runt, commoditised cousin of the banking industry? Driven by deals, spreadsheets, backhanders and frustrated people at the end of their tether? The time is now to build an antidote. When geography matters less than ever, but people and connectedness have never, ever mattered more. Ground-up. Legacy-free. Creatively-ambitious. Strategically-led. Talent-first, forever. THE BUSINESS. We are the UK's first fully independently-funded, fully capable modern media and communication business to launch in over a decade. Like many categories being challenged and disrupted, we’re building our business on a foundation of honesty, openness and ambition but critically on a genuine market opportunity. We are striving to eliminate the vast waste and bloat clients see in the advertising sector and replace it with smart thinking and ideas that deliver real, tangible and accountable value. This agency isn’t just ‘another independent’, especially not one that claims to act unlike the networks but deploys precisely the same practices behind-the-scenes as its bigger cousins. We are building an entirely new class of agency; one that blends C-suite level strategic brand flair with deep tech and platform nous. One with true global capability from day one. One that understands, at its core, that media is an experience and thus must be treated accordingly. As an owner-funded and managed enterprise we are entirely free of the shackles of third-party meddling and free to create a business in entirely the image which we see fit, leaving behind the multiplicity of frustrations that come with complex ownership structures at the door. This agency puts real human behaviour and insight above the usual industry claimed or extrapolated standards. We look to what’s next rather than what’s been before, and constantly pushes the boundaries in R&D and innovation when it comes to understanding the effect of our work. THE PERSON.

Here at graze we’re on a never-ending hunt for tastier, crunchier, fresher, better snacking. Why? Because we want to help people enjoy healthy living every day. We think snacks made with seriously tasty, wholesome ingredients and lots of imagination is a good place to start. After all, it’s what’s helped us become one of the market leaders. Now part of the Unilever family, we remain true to our nimble, tech-led beginnings to find ways to grow our multi-channel brand within the healthy snacking market. We’re a bunch of like-minded people but we’re not all the same. We’re a diverse lot with different experiences and backgrounds but, like our snacks, we combine to make something wonderful. You can be yourself, feel like you belong, as you’d like to belong. the role, Data Analyst... Data analytics at graze is that important to us, fuelled by data is one of our company’s values. The Data team plays the vital role of building and supporting the systems that enable our commercial and operational teams to make data-driven decisions. The role of a graze Data Analyst is to generate and deliver insight from the broad range of data sources that are integrated into our data warehouse. We aim to automate as much as we possibly can; the majority of everyday decisions are made off the back of self-serve analytics tools that we’ve built, leaving us to get stuck into the most challenging and impactful business problems! We are looking for a curious and commercially-minded Data Analyst to focus on driving forward our data capabilities, primarily on the Retail-side of our business. Technology... The core skill set for this role is SQL and data visualisation, using Tableau. Our AWS Redshift data warehouse is populated by a custom-built batch job scheduling system, which orchestrates hundreds of ETL processes per day. The wealth of data that comes from a vertically-integrated and multi-market consumer goods business means that our data sets and analytics capabilities are really diverse. Our core data platform (“graze stats”) is primarily written in PHP, deployed on Docker on AWS ECS, and we rely on other AWS services like S3, Lambda and SQS. Business users can download and upload data to the data warehouse via self-serve tools in our internal web application, and we use Tableau for data visualisation. In 2021, we are starting to migrate our data pipelines away from an in-house system towards a more modern data stack, including Apache Airflow, Stitch and dbt. There will be plenty of opportunity to get involved in the implementation of these new technologies, working alongside and learning from our Data Engineer.

Some examples of the type of questions and challenges you’ll be helping us tackle: How are our sales KPIs tracking against our short and long-term targets? How impactful was our latest promotion in driving both trial of the brand and healthy repeat purchase behaviour? How do visitors to our website behave on-site and what are the main drop-off points in our customer conversion journeys? What makes a best-seller, and how can we use this insight to inform our product innovation? How can we free up time and resource by automating manual processes, enabling the Retail team to do more of what they do best? What we’re looking for in you... You’re curious! You have an ability to quickly learn and adapt, with fast problem-solving capabilities You have strong SQL skills, and a burning desire to continue to develop your skill set in the field of data analytics You’re personable, a natural collaborator and an effective communicator - you’re exceptional at explaining complex ideas in a digestible way for non-technical people What we expect in the first 6 months... Gain a solid understanding of graze’s data analytics, systems and business processes Be in a position to confidently build and productionise new SQL pipelines and Tableau workbooks Build strong relationships with your team and key people you work with What we can offer you...

The ideal candidate will have an interest in renewable technology to join us working on optimal scheduling of smart home devices such as electric vehicles, batteries and heating. About us At Evergreen Energy we use smart technology to help our customers dramatically cut their carbon emissions and reduce their energy bills! We believe that making our homes more energy-efficient, and using renewable technology to heat and power them, will play a big part in achieving a sustainable future. What you’ll be doing Our energy system is changing: we are decarbonising power generation by increasing renewable capacity (e.g. offshore wind), while at the same time increasing demand by electrifying our transport and heating. By using smart technology we can make sure we use the cheap, low-carbon energy when it is available. Energy suppliers have started to offer dynamic electricity tariffs e.g. Agile by Octopus Energy, where prices change to reflect the availability of renewable energy and demand on the energy system. This means that by using electricity during times of high renewable energy production or high renewable generation customers can save money on their energy bills. You will join our Smart Home team, focused on the development of integrated hardware and software solutions for optimisation of domestic energy usage. For example, our Homely Hub smart thermostat enables automatic scheduling of heating to meet user-specified temperature setpoints in the most efficient manner. The Homely Hub is designed specifically to work with energy-efficient heat pumps, maximising their performance while taking advantage of dynamic electricity tariffs, cutting both cost and carbon footprint. We are also extending the functionality of the Homely Hub to control batteries, monitor and account for PV production and in the future integrate with EV chargers for a fully integrated smart home system. The successful candidate will take the lead on enhancing our current optimisation algorithms, working alongside the Head of Smart Home. The work will include: Improvement/Programming of algorithms for optimal scheduling and control of domestic energy usage Improving and designing algorithms that would instruct domestic devices such as heat pumps when to operate, in turn achieving the most cost-efficient operation of the heat pump whilst accounting for solar power production, battery charge levels and other power consumption in the home. Working closely with the engineering team to automate the identification of heating systems that are underperforming. Heat transfer modelling in buildings and parameter estimation using real-world data. A simple example where we start with a simple equation to represent the heat dynamics of the building dI/dt=a(T-I) + bH where, I - internal temperature of the building ℃ T - external temperature ℃ a - heat transfer between indoor and outdoor b - heat transfer coefficient of the heating system. H - heater output kW Check how well the observed temperature (real-world data) fits the simplified modelling. Identify variables that could be affecting the internal temperature of the building outside the model. Improve on the simplified model of the building by including these variables. Estimate the best parameters a and b that fit the observed real-world data. Essential Skills/Experience and Qualities PhD, MSc or equivalent experience in a modelling or scientific programming discipline, for example: Applied Mathematics Physics Software Engineering Data Science Financial Mathematics Required Skills/Experience and Qualities Demonstrable experience of scientific programming in Python (numpy, scipy, vectorisation) A can-do attitude to problem-solving Ability to work within a multi-disciplinary team to reach a common goal Excellent communication skills, particularly technical documentation Desirable Skills/Experience and Qualities Numerical techniques for the solution of PDEs Model calibration using real-world data Optimal control/scheduling problems Pandas AWS An interest in “green” technology, e.g. heat pumps Why work with us: Working at the forefront of building smarter and greener future Competitive salary Minimum 25 days holiday, on top of public holidays Health care expenses scheme Flexible working Pension contributions matched by the company up to 4% Cycle to Work scheme Show more Show less",https://uk.linkedin.com/jobs/view/data-scientist-at-evergreen-energy-2609275447?refId=FupMHlK%2BoEScT48OTFT2fQ%3D%3D&trackingId=kVP057d279j3oUgBWN%2Fmeg%3D%3D&position=14&pageNum=2&trk=public_jobs_jserp-result_search-card,N/A

How we Strive to Behave towards our Colleagues and Customers 1. Influence The ability to change or alter someone's view, agree a common understanding or starting point and the ability to take others with you to achieve a goal. Build trust, know your stakeholders and what matters to them, be clear about your goals, and inspire confidence. Lead by example and don't use force. 2. Leadership The ability to lead from the front and to lead from behind. Leading from the front is leading by example and demonstrating the required behaviours, skills, posture that you expect from others. Leading from behind is encouraging and empowering others to be their best, to learn and to grow. Anyone can lead on anything no matter where you sit in the org chart. ""Example isn't another way to teach; it's the only way to teach."" Einstein 3. Intellectual Curiosity The ability and desire to acquire knowledge, to learn and to better understand something to solve problems, answer questions, and get to the root cause of an issue. This can be done through research, active listening, asking clarifying questions to better understand the customer or stakeholders. Intellectual curiosity is a leading indicator in learning agility. 4. Accountability Feeling pride and ownership around your outputs, how you carry yourself , how you show up at work by managing your workflow, delivering to deadlines and alerting others when an output will be late and ensuring you deliver your best work all the time. You take a critical eye to your own output as well as your peers. 5. Growth Mindset A growth mindset is the belief that you are in control of your own ability, and can learn and improve and is the key to success. This requires you to be proactive in pushing yourself, finding stretch opportunities (this should make you uncomfortable), failing and learning and taking feedback on board that helps you develop and also continue to do what you do best. 6. Spirit of Generosity An openness and willingness to share your time, knowledge and experience to help others succeed. No task is too big, or too small to help out a colleague or client. You go above and beyond every time to be a team player and ensure everyone succeeds.

We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners. Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making. Data scientists at Deliveroo report into our data science management team, and we have a strong, active data science community, with guest lecturers; a robust technical review process; a career progression framework; and plenty of opportunities to learn new things. We have career pathways for both managers and individual contributors. Our Data Scientists come from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, economics/econometrics, physics, psychology, finance, computer science, operations research, cognitive neuroscience and engineering. Some are formally trained in data science, some are not. We have team members from all over the world, and have a dedicated data science diversity committee. As a Data Scientist at Deliveroo, your main goal is business impact. You will help answer questions like: Which markets/cities should we enter next? How should we improve our consumer, rider, and restaurant apps? How can we incentivise good rider behaviour? What is the business impact of exclusive deals we have with restaurants? How do we best optimise our compensation policy to keep our customers happy and ordering with Deliveroo? How does a new competitor’s entry into one of our markets affect our growth ambitions? Can the food delivery market sustain multiple players? What are the trade-offs we face when choosing between growth and profitability? How should we decide between them? How should we make investment decisions company-wide? How should we decide which rider to assign to a given order? Which restaurants should we show a given customer? What is the optimum selection and variety of restaurants in a particular area? What impact do online reviews have? How will a change in the user interface affect customer choice behaviour?

We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them. There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

When you know who you’re speaking to and why, you can create content and campaigns that stand out to the people that matter. Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behavior and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust. It’s been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we’ve become one of the UK’s fastest growing target audience companies, consistently renewing over 98% of our client base and doubling in size and revenue year-on-year. Our survey now represents more than 2 billion connected consumers, creating over 40,000 data points for clients including Twitter, Google, Spotify, WPP and Omnicom Group. We’re not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we’re on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we’re on the lookout for talented people to join us. About Diversity And Inclusion Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We’d get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn’t have got off the ground as a business. We’re so lucky to live in a society where differences are celebrated – so we’d expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, and it’s really important to us that it stays that way. That means whatever your race, religion, sexual orientation or gender, this is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.

iwoca,"Marketing and Advertising, Internet, and Financial Services","London, England, United Kingdom",www.linkedin.com/company/iwoca,Data & Risk Analyst,2021-05-27,United Kingdom,Data Analyst,2611159825,Associate,Full-time,Finance and Sales,"iwoca started in 2012 and was born out of the frustration that small businesses lack the access to finance they need to reach their potential. Our belief then was that technology must enable us to significantly shorten the archaic 8-week bank application process which more often than not results in a ‘no’. Nearly a decade later and we have served more than 50,000 businesses across the UK and Germany with more than £2 billion of finance. Our personal best from a business starting an application to money in the bank is 3m26s (faster than Mo Farah on 1,500 meters). It’s a good start, but it’s just the beginning. Our mission is to finance 1 million businesses, so still, a long way to go. Through the course of our journey, we have learned that SME lending is a tech play at heart - processing applications from SMEs of all shapes and sizes is very complex, and the effective use of technology is essential for doing that at scale Embedded finance is the future for SME lending - businesses won’t need to go to banks anymore. We’re increasingly reaching businesses by embedding our finance offering through API integrations into the SME ecosystem including online marketplaces, accountancy systems, or neobanks Payments and credit are converging Many businesses have cash-flow gaps because they receive money from their customers only way after having to pay their own bills. So we want to tackle the cashflow problem by offering loans, but also tackle the problem at its root by improving payment terms. We must continuously innovate in order to meet more of our customers’ finance needs - we won the BCR which helped us launch iwocapay, and we're soon launching a revenue-based loan.

Our technology transforms the way credit checking and credit scores work by generating a more accurate and holistic view of a borrower's creditworthiness. We’re working with lenders to help them make better, fairer credit decisions and with consumers to help them access fair, affordable credit. Credit Kudos is looking for a Data Scientist. We’re building a new kind of credit score powered by real financial behaviour. We’re looking for a motivated, enthusiastic data scientist who is interested in modelling financial behaviour to improve the financial resilience of consumers and help democratise access to mainstream financial services. Credit plays an integral role in society and without accurate credit scoring we predict a huge section of the population will be unfairly excluded. We're democratising access to credit and removing these false negatives. You’ll be breaking new ground at the very heart of the business, making decisions that will steer lending outcomes for hundreds of thousands of people. What You'll Be Doing Put simply, you’ll be analysing financial transaction data to understand what factors contribute to credit-worthiness. We’re building fair models of risk that are backed up by facts, so you’ll be utilising machine learning and predictive analytics to detect patterns in real financial behaviour that lead to defaults in loan repayments. Lending is as much about financial health as it is about propensity to repay, so you’ll be deconstructing and explaining your models to help consumers increase their financial resilience. As experimentation evolves, previously unknown ideas could likely have business impact, so you’ll be prototyping internal tooling for future experimentation. Data Science is an expansive field, so you’ll have the freedom to explore scientific research in work and during dedicated personal development time. Collaborating with the research science team to learn and build upon your data science skillset. Requirements Grounding in statistics/CS theory and core Machine Learning principles. Can take a large dataset and answer key business questions in a repeatable, testable manner. Work in a scientific manner, establishing hypotheses, success criteria and conducting relevant experiments. Experience developing and testing data science models, experience in relevant technology stacks, e.g. R, Python (pandas, scikit-learn), SQL etc Some experience in building APIs or backend services useful but not required. Ideally 2-4 years experience working in a commercial setting in the data science field. Benefits A ton of support, but an opportunity to run your own schedule and role. The opportunity to develop your role and responsibilities as the company grows. Have a real impact on credit scoring changing the industry for the better. A Competitive salary with stock options. A Workplace pension. Flexible working arrangements with 2-3 days in office. MacBook Pro and equipment. Generous leave, a total of 36 days (inc Bank Holidays) A dog-friendly office.

We're the UK's largest integrated digital retailer and financial services provider, and we've been helping customers say yes when it matters most for over 100 years. In that time, we've consistently reinvented our business to adapt to economic conditions and industry changes - going from bricks, to clicks, to mobile. But despite our passion for reinvention, we've never wavered from our purpose; to make good things easily accessible to more people. It means giving our customers the brands they love, an outstanding shopping experience and flexible ways to spread the cost. We've continued to deliver for our customers throughout the Covid-19 outbreak - and we've done it by transforming the way we work. The role itself will be a mix of on-site vs remote, we've adapted well to remote ways of working and will continue to embrace those practices moving forward. We're fired up for the future and the next stage in our development. We'll give customers access to more great brands for themselves and their families, a seamless shopping experience and even more control of their finances through innovation in flexible ways to pay. The role In a nutshell, you'll be analysing, validating, specifying, verifying and managing the business needs of initiative stakeholders, which includes our customers and end users. The role is varied, so no 2 days will be the same (as cliche as that sounds), some of the work will be complex and non-routine and you'll be able to choose the tools and techniques that help you to deliver the right customer and business outcomes. You have the advantage of coming in to this in the early days, so you'll be able to define the project scope and do your investigation, analysis, review and clear articulation of processes and requirements. We're a big company, and you'll be speaking and liasing with a lot of your colleagues across the business, ranging from people in your own tribe, to other tribes and departments, and also stakeholders; so strong communication skills are a must. The team You'll be joining one of our cross-functional squads within our DNA (Data, iNsight, Action) Tribe. We are on quite an ambitious journey to modernise our Data domain, using new cutting edge technology. This Data domain feeds our Data Science, Analytics, Strategy and Engineering teams. What you need We know you're much more than just a skill-set. Obviously though to set yourself up for success, we'd need a couple of things... Agile experience is essential Data experience would be nice, although if you have other tech experience, then that would work too. Benefits Annual Bonus 30 days holiday + bank holidays (opportunity to buy / sell) Up to 6% matched pension £1000 additional benefits allowance to choose things like healthcare, life assurance and more Up to 25% off at Very Remote/office split Ongoing training and development Next Steps If you're interested to find out more please contact Jordan Barlow in the talent acquisition team or apply online.

Social Finance,,"London, England, United Kingdom",www.linkedin.com/company/socialfinance,Data Analyst,2021-06-09,United Kingdom,Data Analyst,2581812640,,Full-time,,"The Opportunity Our projects are chosen for their potential to change people's lives. A colleague recently said “I joined for the combination of mad ambition and serious strategy.” Recent examples of projects our data analysts worked on include: Exclusions Data Analysis – we recently analysed local authority social care and education data (bringing together 700 datasets) and did user research with decision makers to find new ways to help reduce exclusions. We showed that girls were actually being ‘excluded’ at a higher rate than boys and that their exclusions were hidden by official definitions. Our findings featured in The Guardian. We’re now working on ways to help all local authorities replicate that analysis and have started to develop a new intervention to address the needs of the high-risk students which the analysis identified. Edge of Care Commissioning Tool: Our team developed an analytical model to support children’s social care commissioners identify children at risk of entering care and what support to provide. The model identified children most at risk of entering care as well as eligibility for specialist services. The tool helped 15+ local authorities build the case for investing in preventative services which kept 350 children with their parents instead of being removed into local authority care. Greater Manchester Data Platform – our team are helping Greater Manchester to work out: what use cases exist for a common data platform across a range of public services; what technical, ethical, political, and change management barriers would need to be overcome to realise those; what a roadmap to creating it might entail. Currently in discovery, and we hope to work on the build as well. The work is extremely broad – ranging across predictive risk modelling; classic business intelligence; developing data standards; data engineering; advice on the ethics of data collaborations; and training partners’ data scientists. This breadth is intentional. Rather than trying to develop our own leadership in a single area, we are trying to achieve social change and we take on this wide variety of challenges because these challenges are what lie between us and our goals. You will need to be someone who is excited by that breadth – and by the frequent need for teams to blend technical with policy and service delivery expertise to identify the right solution. Our partners’ data, technology, and in-house capability often constrain what we can do. So, you’ll need to be more energised by that potential for social impact than by getting to use cutting edge data science approaches. You’ll need to think of creative ways to work around those constraints and consider that a part of the fun. About You We expect that your skills and experience will make you comfortable in: Quantitative analysis, using at least one of Python, R or SQL – working with messy datasets to help solve strategic and operational problems for the public sector, charities, and impact-focussed businesses. Communicating insights to non-data people – whether through a conversation, a report, or data visualisation you’ll need to be able to help busy decision makers to act on what you’re finding Working as a Consultant – with the ensuing requirement for excellent time management, balancing multi-projects at the same time, and teamwork. Also being comfortable with ambiguity as the team develops over time a better understanding of the problem, and what might solve it. You’ll also need to be interested in bringing ethics into your work – thinking about how design decisions exacerbate or counter problems such as structural racism and algorithmic bias, or the tendency towards state surveillance of disadvantaged populations. Experience of data engineering challenges would be a bonus, as would experience of public policy, working in the not-for-profit sector, experience of strategy development, or experience of a consulting environment. Our Commitment to You Social Finance offers a range of training and development support, using both in-house expertise and external partners to develop and deliver our training programmes. Alongside the Project Managers you work with day to day, your Line Manager will support you in your career planning and personal development. All new staff have a buddy in place to help them learn about life at Social Finance. The fixed salary for this position is £40,000 per annum. We offer a generous holiday allowance plus bank holidays and corporate leave between Christmas and New Year when the office is closed. We also offer a contributory stakeholder pension scheme, plus an uplift in salary allowance to spend on other benefits, season ticket loans, bike to work schemes and Give as you Earn via salary sacrifice. Encouraging community and wellbeing is important to us. We have a health and wellbeing plan to encourage better working practices for individuals. Social Finance is a disability confident committed employer as well as a founding signature of the UK social investment sector’s Diversity Forum manifesto. About Social Finance We are an ambitious not for profit group organisation aiming to achieve lasting social change that enables people to lead fulfilling lives. We collaborate with governments, funders, community organisations and the wider social sector to create breakthrough solutions to challenging social problems in the UK and internationally. Founded in 2007, our team shares a passion for social impact and includes over 100 employees with a blend of experiences from the public, commercial and voluntary sectors. Our people bring a unique set of skills in digital, data, research, operations, policy, facilitation and financial analysis that is highly valued by our partners in social change. We are based in Vauxhall, London with sister organisations in the US, Israel, India and the Netherlands, as part of the Social Finance Global Network. We are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Our Data and Digital Team In 2015 we started building a team focussed on bringing the power of data science and digital service design to the subset of public and social sector problems which have huge social impact, but which are not attractive to commercial players. Since then we’ve worked with over 40 councils on data and digital projects, as well as NHS Trusts and a range of charities, government departments, and businesses who are looking to have a greater social impact. Our unusual history means that our teams blend an understanding of policy and service delivery with hard technical skills. Our not-for-profit status and strong links with major foundations mean that we can often attract grant funding for exploratory work, for high impact but high-risk projects, and for sector-wide initiatives such as establishment of data standards or pattern libraries. Our data and digital projects are trying to solve a range of big questions including: What is the appropriate role for data in decision making about people who are homeless, children at risk of abuse and neglect, or prison leavers? How can we design apps which empower and support vulnerable people themselves – avoiding the risk of simply giving more power to the professionals who work with them? Unlike think tanks however, we’re actively designing, building and implementing the services which change what is possible and so our engagement in the debate is as practitioners making novel decisions – not as commentators. Diversity and Inclusion We need a diverse organisation to be effective. Our work requires us to bring together people with a broad range of skills and life experiences to ensure our impact across a range of social issues and systems. We are committed to having an inclusive culture and working environment in which everyone feels at home and is supported to achieve their potential. We know there is further to go and are implementing a Diversity and Inclusion strategy with a group of external experts to hold us to account. We actively encourage applications from under-represented and minoritised groups, including those with lived experience of the social issues we are working to address. We are an equal opportunities employer. We support a range of flexible working options and welcome UK based applications from outside of London/the South East so far as they can meet the in-person meeting requirements for the role. We can also accommodate secondments and part-time working.

Shoji,Computer & Network Security,"London, England, United Kingdom",www.linkedin.com/company/shoji,Machine Learning Engineer,2021-06-16,United Kingdom,Data Analyst,2601921064,Not Applicable,Full-time,Engineering,"At Shoji, we're making private data useful and keeping useful data private. We’re building the data sharing infrastructure of tomorrow to help businesses safely unlock the value of their most sensitive digital assets. The Shoji platform lets multiple teams or organisations solve problems, generate insights and even perform machine learning on private datasets, without ever moving or exposing the raw data. We’re motivated by what we enable for others. By unlocking access to data previously beyond reach, there’s no limit to the use-cases made possible. Whether it’s banks being able to improve access to credit, doctors being able to make better diagnosis predictions or governments being able to more effectively allocate resources, we passionately believe that by protecting privacy, we can power the innovations that are most important to society. Who we are, our values and what we look for Founded in March 2021 by a team of statistical machine learning PhD students from Imperial College, we’ve already received over £1.5m of backing from Entrepreneur First and a leading VC. We’re obsessed with technological progress, but only when it respects privacy. This dependency defines the way that we work. We value ambition, curiosity and proactivity, without compromising on transparency, integrity and humanity. We’re looking for people who constantly strive for improvement, in their own work and others’; people who prioritise product, with a bias for action; people with a hunger for solving hard and important problems, fast; people who are always looking to learn, not to be taught. Why being a software engineer at Shoji is different There’s an abundance of opportunity here. Whether you want to be more customer facing, or have ownership of the products you build, or even contribute outside of your main role, we’ll encourage and enable you. We work in small, highly-capable teams (sometimes breaking Bezos’ two-pizza rule, but only because we are gluttons for good pizza!) Meritocracy is one of our founding principles. You will always get full credit for your contributions. So, if you’re currently stuck in a role where you’re going unnoticed or your boss is taking all the credit, come and join us for a better life. We encourage regular, omni-directional feedback so we can all improve and ensure everyone is fine and dandy. We can promise you a huge amount of autonomy, but also support from other brilliant minds. Minimum viable bureaucracy no unnecessary meetings taking your time away from building. What You Should Know Before You Consider Applying We steer clear of rigid requirements because we want to hire the best people for the role, regardless of their background, and that’s impossible to define on paper. It doesn’t matter if you’re fresh out of university, or if you’ve honed your technical skills without pursuing further education. We love our people T-shaped. As long as you’re a fast learner and brilliant engineer, we generally don’t care about experience with specific technologies. You don’t have to be a privacy enthusiast right now, but we’ll bet you that soon after you join, you’ll become one! What You’ll Be Doing As one of the early software engineers, you’ll have the opportunity to play a key role in the success of Shoji. Your responsibilities will evolve with the business, but here are just some of the things we’ll need you for Implementing cutting-edge research in the privacy-preserving ML space. Building an entire ecosystem of federated ML tools and services by extending existing OSS. This will evolve into our own ML and analytics platform in the future. Working closely with the CTO to develop new and extend existing ML procedures. This is an opportunity to get more involved from a research perspective if you want to, but you’ll be able to choose the balance between research and engineering that best suits you. Optimising algorithms to make sure our ML components are fast AF. Longer term, you’ll be expected to mentor and coach the more junior members of the team as we grow. Strong signs that you should apply You have strong exposure to a wide range of ML techniques to the extent where you could confidently discuss, reason about and write pseudocode for the main topics in any core ML textbook (e.g. ESL, or Bishop's PRML). You believe that ethics need to play a bigger role in the use of data for ML. You should be able to comfortably wrangle data to your will, whether it exists in a SQL database, a CSV, or some hierarchical format like JSON. You cringe when people talk about “big data”, and want to work with a team that understands ML isn’t magic. You think “federated learning” has become another buzzword. You write tests that ensure that the maths makes sense. You relish the challenge of building scalable models in restrictive environments. You love being hands on and throwing yourself into code. If your current/last role was senior then you should have learned to delegate, but you should wish you could get back to being more involved again. The ideal person has A demonstrable, strong engineering background with good software development practices. Open-source contributions would be a big plus here, especially for projects in the data science/ML space. Solid experience with using DL frameworks and architectures for a variety of tasks. Experience implementing ML models in professional software production environments, including integrating with data processing pipelines. A good understanding of how to assess and improve both time and space computational complexity at the algorithm level, independent of programming language. Lots of exposure to the python data science stack would be very useful (despite our generally technology agnostic attitude, you would likely struggle in the role without this). Benefits 💰 £50–80k salary based on experience. 📈 Competitive employee stock options so you can share in the company's success. 🧘‍♀️ Flexible work arrangements both hours and location. ⛵ 28 days holiday and we’ll give you £1k in holiday vouchers to take that time off. 🔧 £2k equipment budget so you can work with the tools you love. 🏥 Private health insurance. 🐣 Paid maternity and paternity leave. ☕ Free coffee/drinks in the office. 🥗 Who said there’s no such thing as a free lunch? Team lunches are free on Friday. 🍕 Pizza oven in the office. How The Application Process Works At Shoji, we're looking for people with drive, grit and initiative.

We have the privilege to work with a wide range of ambitious clients who want to develop new technology. As a result we work across a huge range of projects, from agricultural and industrial robotics, to indoor location systems, to hyperspectral imaging of skin. We are looking for people who are motivated by the idea of applying their data analysis and modelling skills to real-world engineering. Role description You will be responsible for implementing and evaluating algorithms as part of our many technology development projects. Often you will work as part of a multi-disciplinary team.

Our collaborative and supportive working environment allows our engineers to quickly develop their skills and knowledge in unfamiliar areas. This role provides a valuable opportunity to work alongside and learn from more experienced colleagues in both your own and related fields. As you grow in experience you will get the opportunity to take on increasingly challenging tasks and will start to take on more responsibility for interactions with our clients, working with others to identify and define the technical solutions that will solve their problems. While we take the quality of our work very seriously, you will find that we have a friendly and informal work environment. While work can be hectic when deadlines loom, we care about having a healthy work-life balance.

Our technology is used by hundreds of brands and content-owners to safely engage with over half a billion kids every month. For SuperAwesome ‘law is opportunity,’ as we develop innovative technology-based solutions to enable compliance with global data protection laws and child safety best practices. The Role We’re looking for people who’ve collaborated on designing and building successful products that users love. Specifically, we’re looking for an awesome Business Analyst to help us build out our Kids Web Services platform and deliver on our mission to make the internet safer for kids. You’ll be the Business Analyst working across two cross-functional teams, each of 4-9 software engineers, product managers and designers. You are excellent at prioritisation, highly analytical, and research-centric in your thinking. You’ll ideally have some previous experience researching both B2B products and consumer ‘utility’-style B2C products (e.g. checkout, identity/login, search). The Business Analyst works to solve the problems described by the Product Manager, based on expert knowledge of and research into our customers’ business objectives, an understanding of the competitive environment, of technical solutions and constraints, and the requirements of kids’ digital privacy regulation around the world. The Product Kids Web Services (KWS) is a kidtech platform for developers who are creating engaging and innovative kid-led experiences. It provides out-of-the-box solutions to compliantly handle kids personal data, and for developers to give parents visibility and control over that data. KWS allows our developer customers to outsource the complexity of kids’ data privacy, so they can get on with the job of making the most awesome game, content experience or toy. For kids and parents, we provide transparency and control over how their data is used and collected. For our business, KWS connects us deeply with companies’ products and allows us to drive a huge impact with the developer community. Since our acquisition by Epic Games, Kids Web Services is set for massive growth and we want you to help us improve and scale our product. The better developers, kids and parents understand how parental verification, consent and controls work and why they are needed, the more effective our product is for our customers. The developer documentation, the quality of the APIs and the developer portal are all important, but ultimately the quality of the kid and parent-facing UX is what drives the success of KWS against our mission of making the internet safer for kids. What you’ll be doing Maintain SuperAwesome’s database of consent and verification standards by keeping abreast of any children-specific data protection provisions in data privacy laws around the world. Liaise with external legal counsel, information resources and kids privacy/safety experts to maintain our internal knowledge base on international kids-specific regulations. Analyse and document kids digital experiences, including games and websites, and digital platforms (app store, game consoles, etc), to understand and map their log-in and consent flows in relation to kids across different territories. Research, develop & maintain a register of vendors of age detection, age verification, and identity verification vendors around the world, mapping their capabilities against the needs of our Kids Web Services solution. Own and execute a plan to contact relevant vendors of verification solutions, assess their offerings and prepare to test them for potential use with KWS. Lead negotiations with selected vendors to run tests for effectiveness and scalability, and project-manage the integration of chosen offerings with KWS. Work closely with the KWS product manager, chief privacy officer and CTO to ideate and design potential new parent verification solutions for use in US (compliant with COPPA), EU (compliant with GDPR-K), and the rest of world (compliant and appropriate to the SuperAwesome standard). Where relevant, project-manage the drafting and submission of applications to regulatory authorities (such as the FTC) for approved new verification methods. What is it like to work here? We’re 180 people split across timezones and markets, so we have a real focus on optimising for remote communication and collaboration. Our product management and development teams are based out of our London HQ in Charing Cross. You’ll find people from all walks of life here as well as a real focus on health and wellbeing. Our (current) work-from-home culture is lively and inclusive, with a genuine focus on building human connection and empathy during these strange times.

We value everyone's skills and provide a creative and supportive environment to help you do your best work and develop your career.

These include a mixture of legacy systems and new critical infrastructure currently being delivered. This role will support the Child Abuse Image Database (CAID) programme. CAID has embarked on an ambitious transformation programme to help the police and law enforcement partners continue to safeguard children and pursue offenders in the face of technology changes and the unfortunate continuing growing volumes of cases.

The CAID system contains the UK national IIoC library and related data (image metadata, categorisation, hash values and case-related information).

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our users. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore, driving strategy and key decision-making, which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business. ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact. You will be focused initially in the area of Product Analytics – understanding how different segments of users interact (or don’t interact) with our product and what strategies will make the product more useful and valuable to them. There is currently a team of three: a mid-level Analyst and two Data Scientists. Exciting challenges that make this different to a pure Product Analytics role include leveraging ML models to surface the best actions for users; which credit products might be right for them, how they might improve their credit score or how they might improve their use of credit products more generally. New journeys we are creating include “Build” which aims to help users enter the credit market safely and “Protect” which helps them understand their exposure to fraud. Examples Of How You Might Drive Impact Creating insight into user behaviour using empirical data Working with the Data Scientists to get them working on the most impactful projects Developing new segmentations to drive better user insight Taking the analytic and “experimentation” led culture in the product team to the next level Creating the insights to enable our Product team to shape the overall product vision Driving a “data first” mentality with the Product Managers to ensure that they are tracking the right data and interpreting it correctly About You You do not need to fit into a stereotype: we are really committed to closing our gender gap and are actively trying to create an environment where you, as an individual, can thrive. You have significant experience ideally in product analysis; maybe you have worked for a tech company previously or possibly in Lending. You think about users, not just numbers, understanding the key drivers of churn, engagement and activation. You do not need to be a Data Scientist, but it would be great if you understand the best use cases for machine learning, potential drawbacks for using such models in our product, and are able to ‘translate’ Data Science approaches to business outcomes. You are a great manager – the people who will be reporting to you are very bright and very talented. You will enjoy helping them grow and thrive. You enjoy helping non-analysts to put data at the heart of what they do – through A/B testing, use of analytical tools such as Amplitude, or training others to carry out their own analysis. Aptitude and passion for statistics/mathematics: the majority of our analysts have good degrees in STEM subjects or Economics; however we are looking for aptitude rather than education. You must know SQL and will ideally know Python. Experience with tools such as Amplitude is a plus. An inquiring mind that seeks for the insight in the data. You can synthesise information into clear and logical presentations. You want to learn as much as possible. A desire to contribute to our culture. About Clearscore ClearScore is a workplace like no other. We’ve spent the past five years disrupting an entire industry and building a user base of millions. At the heart of this success is our culture, where we work hard, relish change and treat each other with respect—helping everyone to reach their potential and deliver results that make a difference. We’re on a mission to positively impact the lives of our users. Our product puts their needs at the centre of our thinking. Through cutting-edge tech, insightful analytics and beautiful design we want to help our users build their financial confidence and make better financial decisions. We want our people to perform at their best, so we trust everyone to work in a way that suits them—focusing on output, not time spent at a screen. We have an inclusive culture where everyone is encouraged to look after their own wellbeing whilst growing and developing their career.

You will join the team in delivering insight and analysis which allow ClearScore to rapidly scale and deliver a seamless experience for our users. Analysts play a key role within ClearScore, driving strategy and key decision-making, which ultimately benefits our users, partners and other teams within the business. ClearScore has an amazing analytical community which includes Data Analysts, Scientists and Engineers. The community works collaboratively to ensure a landscape in which team members can develop their full potential and deliver maximum business impact. You will be focused initially in the area of Product Analytics – understanding how different segments of users interact (or don’t interact) with our product and what strategies will make the product more useful and valuable to them. There is currently a team of three: a mid-level Analyst and two Data Scientists. Exciting challenges that make this different to a pure Product Analytics role include leveraging ML models to surface the best actions for users; which credit products might be right for them, how they might improve their credit score or how they might improve their use of credit products more generally. New journeys we are creating include “Build” which aims to help users enter the credit market safely and “Protect” which helps them understand their exposure to fraud. Examples Of How You Might Drive Impact Creating insight into user behaviour using empirical data Working with the Data Scientists to get them working on the most impactful projects Developing new segmentations to drive better user insight Taking the analytic and “experimentation” led culture in the product team to the next level Creating the insights to enable our Product team to shape the overall product vision Driving a “data first” mentality with the Product Managers to ensure that they are tracking the right data and interpreting it correctly About You You do not need to fit into a stereotype: we are really committed to closing our gender gap and are actively trying to create an environment where you, as an individual, can thrive. You have significant experience ideally in product analysis; maybe you have worked for a tech company previously or possibly in Lending. You think about users, not just numbers, understanding the key drivers of churn, engagement and activation. You do not need to be a Data Scientist, but it would be great if you understand the best use cases for machine learning, potential drawbacks for using such models in our product, and are able to ‘translate’ Data Science approaches to business outcomes. You are a great manager – the people who will be reporting to you are very bright and very talented. You will enjoy helping them grow and thrive. You enjoy helping non-analysts to put data at the heart of what they do – through A/B testing, use of analytical tools such as Amplitude, or training others to carry out their own analysis. Aptitude and passion for statistics/mathematics: the majority of our analysts have good degrees in STEM subjects or Economics; however we are looking for aptitude rather than education. You must know SQL and will ideally know Python. Experience with tools such as Amplitude is a plus. An inquiring mind that seeks for the insight in the data. You can synthesise information into clear and logical presentations. You want to learn as much as possible. A desire to contribute to our culture. About Clearscore ClearScore is a workplace like no other. We’ve spent the past five years disrupting an entire industry and building a user base of millions. At the heart of this success is our culture, where we work hard, relish change and treat each other with respect—helping everyone to reach their potential and deliver results that make a difference. We’re on a mission to positively impact the lives of our users. Our product puts their needs at the centre of our thinking. Through cutting-edge tech, insightful analytics and beautiful design we want to help our users build their financial confidence and make better financial decisions. We want our people to perform at their best, so we trust everyone to work in a way that suits them—focusing on output, not time spent at a screen. We have an inclusive culture where everyone is encouraged to look after their own wellbeing whilst growing and developing their career.
