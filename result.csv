DevOps Engineer

As a DevOps Engineer, you'll use cutting edge technology to support our GVP infrastructure, building CI/CD pipelines, Terraform frameworks and other reusable componentecs to accelerate and scale our IaC adoption. You'll also be getting involved in training other team members to follow DevOps best practices such as IaC.

So that's what we're after, but what makes us special?

The telecommunications industry in its current form is pretty uninspiring. But we’re fixated on mixing that up. Our aim is to leave the pack far behind, by delivering some of those once-in-a-lifetime, rocket-to-the-stars ideas that turn the industry and customer expectations on their heads.

And why do we do it? Well, we make no secret of the fact, we want to become the most recommended brand, by our people and our customers. A massive part of that journey is about how we ensure that our brilliant people have a working environment in which they can truly belong and thrive. For us, it's critical that every single person can bring, and be, their whole selves at work, and we're working hard every day to achieve this.

Tell me more, tell me more…

In role, you'll work with highly skilled DevOps Engineers, ML Engineers, Data Scientists and Software Engineers side by side to build powerful data products and services (including MLOps) that would really improve our customer’s experience at Virgin Media. The team we are building works in a start-up-like environment (yeah, you heard that right!).

The must haves:


Have strong Terraform skills
Have built and owned CI/CD pipelines before
Operational experience with Kubernetes
Have good understanding of security best practices on a Cloud environment, including managing secret and service account
Good knowledge of networking such as VPC, subnets, routing and firewalls
Cloud experience is required, preferably GCP



Other stuff we're looking for:


Experience in having worked in an Agile environment
Have a good understanding of distributed computing
Have deployed production systems using GitLab pipelines and Cloud Build



What we use:


Terraform
GitLab, Cloud Build and anything else that makes sense



What's in it for you?

We know that benefits mean so much more than the 'stuff' we can give you, so we offer a wide range of support, rewards and tools - all focused on helping you to prioritise what really matters.

All work and no play just isn't our style! We're already planning our future ways of working, for when life becomes a little more normal again. We're constantly evolving our approach to enable you to find a great work life balance.

If you go on to be successful in your application, some of the many benefits include:


25 days' annual leave, plus UK bank holidays.
A defined contribution pension scheme, run by Fidelity, matched up to 10%.
Access to wellbeing benefits such as the Unmind App, personal medical cover (which you can opt to upgrade to cover loved ones) and critical illness cover.
Season ticket loans
Your birthday off every year, to treat yourself.
The option to buy and sell up to 5 days leave, to suit your personal needs.



Next steps

If you think you've got some amazing skills to offer us, and Virgin Media feels like a place where you can belong, we'd love to learn more about you. Once you've submitted an application the next steps of the process, if successful, are likely to include a two-stage interview process including technical and competency assessments.

When you apply, you'll be asked about any adjustments you might need to support the recruitment process. Let us know, and we'll be sure to discuss it with you.

Thanks for your patience in the meantime and for showing an interest in joining the Virgin Media family.

﻿

Having delivered some of the biggest and first dynamics cloud transformation projects on a global scale, they have a long-standing reputation of successful project delivery which has contributed to their growth. They have helped the NHS and multiple councils during covid to provide a better service using the MSFT platform, and sometimes as a gift to struggling councils as part of their CSR approach to building a better future.

 

Business Growth:

 

As a business, they have grown consistently for the past 5 years and are now up to 550 employees in Europe and 300 in the UK.

 

They have had immense success this year having added 50 new clients since April 2020 and have 137 current active customers across a variety of sectors. If you would like to expand your sector experience their portfolio would support you to do this.

We’re bringing innovation and user-centric thinking into a traditionally offline journey, delicately weaving together the conveniences of a digital experience and the trust of meaningful human touchpoints.



We bring together people with a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage collaboration, big thinking, and experimentation in a blame-free environment. We promote self-direction to work on meaningful projects within a supportive and nurturing environment.




We’re currently looking for Backend Engineers to join our Platform team. We’re looking for engineers who have experience working with platforms as well as writing software - you’re as comfortable writing code to solve problems as you are operating AWS or Kubernetes.

If you’re a software engineer who has some good cloud infrastructure experience already, or you’re eager to get really familiar with systems, tooling and libraries, this could be the role for you.




At Strike, you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology

We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:

AWS for most of our infrastructure
Terraform to deliver infrastructure as code
GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
Elasticsearch and Kibana for logging and monitoring
MySQL for persistent data storage
PHP for our backend application code
React for our client-side applications




On the Platform Team, you will

Help migrate our services to Kubernetes
Engage in and improve the whole lifecycle of services—from inception and design, deployment, operation, and refinement
Support services before they go live through activities such as system design consulting, developing software platforms and frameworks, capacity planning, and launch reviews
Maintain services once they are live by measuring and monitoring availability, latency, and overall system health
Scale systems sustainably through mechanisms like automation; evolve systems by pushing for changes that improve reliability and velocity
Practice sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems




You should apply if you have

Fluency in one or more programming languages and are able to write clean and effective code
The ability to build reliable and well-tested infrastructure on top of cloud computing systems
Experience in designing, analysing, and troubleshooting distributed systems
Knowledge of Unix fundamentals




It's useful, but not essential to have

Experience managing Kubernetes environments
Experience with relational databases and other stores, especially around optimising their performance




More reasons to join us

We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
The COVID-19 pandemic has seen everybody at Strike shift to remote working and this is something we’ll continue to do into 2021. However, as things return to normal you may be required to work the occasional day at our modern office in Colchester, Essex (located within 10 minutes walk of Colchester mainline train station). However, if you would prefer to work from the office, then this is also an option.
Initially 30 days holiday (inc bank holidays), plus an additional day for each year of employment.
Access to training and development programmes

What is DevOps?

DevOps is an environment, a philosophical mindset and a real-world framework that's taken business ecosystems by a storm. That doesn't mean much though, does it, let's see if we can describe it better...

Just as the title says, it brings together development and operations so that organisations can create stable, repeatable platforms for product deployment.

To become a DevOps specialist you need to have both technical and soft skills to seamlessly integrate with multiple teams. Engineers use tools to deploy infrastructure as code, create automation and test the platform during deployment and hook in monitoring systems for rapid up to date reporting; commitment to communication bridges it all together and breaks down team silos. By creating a DevOps culture, businesses deliver systems faster, cheaper and without sacrificing high quality by working in-line with agile methodology and pushing it to the limits to manage the entire lifecycle of software.

Don't worry, you're not expected to know how to do all of this already, that's where we come in.

We can take your already outstanding skillsets and train you much further to the level of a specialist consultant.

We want to help you grow into someone that can use niche skillsets from Continuous Delivery to Cloud Platforms and everything in between. By training in one of our world class academies we will make you a specialist consultant who will then work with our clients to help them realise their business needs.

Why work for us?

We take time and care to develop your abilities and confidence, your success is our success - together we make other businesses stronger.

As a DevOps Engineer, you'll use cutting edge technology to support our GVP infrastructure, building CI/CD pipelines, Terraform frameworks and other reusable componentecs to accelerate and scale our IaC adoption. You'll also be getting involved in training other team members to follow DevOps best practices such as IaC.

So that's what we're after, but what makes us special?

The telecommunications industry in its current form is pretty uninspiring. But we’re fixated on mixing that up. Our aim is to leave the pack far behind, by delivering some of those once-in-a-lifetime, rocket-to-the-stars ideas that turn the industry and customer expectations on their heads.

And why do we do it? Well, we make no secret of the fact, we want to become the most recommended brand, by our people and our customers. A massive part of that journey is about how we ensure that our brilliant people have a working environment in which they can truly belong and thrive. For us, it's critical that every single person can bring, and be, their whole selves at work, and we're working hard every day to achieve this.

Tell me more, tell me more…

Have built and owned CI/CD pipelines before
Operational experience with Kubernetes
Have good understanding of security best practices on a Cloud environment, including managing secret and service account
Good knowledge of networking such as VPC, subnets, routing and firewalls

Other stuff we're looking for:


Experience in having worked in an Agile environment
Have a good understanding of distributed computing
Have deployed production systems using GitLab pipelines and Cloud Build



What we use:


Terraform
GitLab, Cloud Build and anything else that makes sense



What's in it for you?

We know that benefits mean so much more than the 'stuff' we can give you, so we offer a wide range of support, rewards and tools - all focused on helping you to prioritise what really matters.

All work and no play just isn't our style! We're already planning our future ways of working, for when life becomes a little more normal again. We're constantly evolving our approach to enable you to find a great work life balance.

If you go on to be successful in your application, some of the many benefits include:


25 days' annual leave, plus UK bank holidays.
A defined contribution pension scheme, run by Fidelity, matched up to 10%.
Access to wellbeing benefits such as the Unmind App, personal medical cover (which you can opt to upgrade to cover loved ones) and critical illness cover.
Season ticket loans
Your birthday off every year, to treat yourself.
The option to buy and sell up to 5 days leave, to suit your personal needs.



Next steps

If you think you've got some amazing skills to offer us, and Virgin Media feels like a place where you can belong, we'd love to learn more about you. Once you've submitted an application the next steps of the process, if successful, are likely to include a two-stage interview process including technical and competency assessments.

When you apply, you'll be asked about any adjustments you might need to support the recruitment process. Let us know, and we'll be sure to discuss it with you.

Thanks for your patience in the meantime and for showing an interest in joining the Virgin Media family.

We’re currently looking for Backend Engineers to join our Platform team. We’re looking for engineers who have experience working with platforms as well as writing software - you’re as comfortable writing code to solve problems as you are operating AWS or Kubernetes.

If you’re a software engineer who has some good cloud infrastructure experience already, or you’re eager to get really familiar with systems, tooling and libraries, this could be the role for you.




At Strike, you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology

AWS for most of our infrastructure
Terraform to deliver infrastructure as code
GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
Elasticsearch and Kibana for logging and monitoring

PHP for our backend application code
React for our client-side applications




On the Platform Team, you will

Help migrate our services to Kubernetes
Engage in and improve the whole lifecycle of services—from inception and design, deployment, operation, and refinement
Support services before they go live through activities such as system design consulting, developing software platforms and frameworks, capacity planning, and launch reviews
Maintain services once they are live by measuring and monitoring availability, latency, and overall system health
Scale systems sustainably through mechanisms like automation; evolve systems by pushing for changes that improve reliability and velocity
Practice sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems




You should apply if you have

Fluency in one or more programming languages and are able to write clean and effective code
The ability to build reliable and well-tested infrastructure on top of cloud computing systems
Experience in designing, analysing, and troubleshooting distributed systems
Knowledge of Unix fundamentals




It's useful, but not essential to have

Experience managing Kubernetes environments
Experience with relational databases and other stores, especially around optimising their performance




More reasons to join us

We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
The COVID-19 pandemic has seen everybody at Strike shift to remote working and this is something we’ll continue to do into 2021. However, as things return to normal you may be required to work the occasional day at our modern office in Colchester, Essex (located within 10 minutes walk of Colchester mainline train station). However, if you would prefer to work from the office, then this is also an option.
Initially 30 days holiday (inc bank holidays), plus an additional day for each year of employment.

What is DevOps?

DevOps is an environment, a philosophical mindset and a real-world framework that's taken business ecosystems by a storm. That doesn't mean much though, does it, let's see if we can describe it better...

Just as the title says, it brings together development and operations so that organisations can create stable, repeatable platforms for product deployment.

To become a DevOps specialist you need to have both technical and soft skills to seamlessly integrate with multiple teams. Engineers use tools to deploy infrastructure as code, create automation and test the platform during deployment and hook in monitoring systems for rapid up to date reporting; commitment to communication bridges it all together and breaks down team silos. By creating a DevOps culture, businesses deliver systems faster, cheaper and without sacrificing high quality by working in-line with agile methodology and pushing it to the limits to manage the entire lifecycle of software.

Don't worry, you're not expected to know how to do all of this already, that's where we come in.

We can take your already outstanding skillsets and train you much further to the level of a specialist consultant.

We want to help you grow into someone that can use niche skillsets from Continuous Delivery to Cloud Platforms and everything in between. By training in one of our world class academies we will make you a specialist consultant who will then work with our clients to help them realise their business needs.

Why work for us?

We take time and care to develop your abilities and confidence, your success is our success - together we make other businesses stronger.

A hands-on technical DevOps Manager is required for a Tier 1 investment bank, working in a global front-office team that supports the Equity Swaps trading business.

 

You will be responsible for the day to day management of a small Devops team and a non-production environment management team. These teams will drive the Devops agenda for regression test tooling automation, environment stability and meeting the Firms infrastructure hygiene requirements

These teams will help deliver increased regression testing efficiency and completeness, resolve issues, as well as continually feed (often large) improvements back into the projects. This will include improving our current test automation, test environments, or even rearchitecting parts of our test process.

 

To succeed, you will need to be strong technically and actively hands-on with an ability to understand low level detail and logic. You should have experience in building custom test pipelines and automated testing tooling. You will need to act as a guide and mentor to your team members in order to achieve your vision.

 

You are likely to have come from a development background. However, you will have had recent proven experience in a testing / release / devops / automation role. You might be entirely hands-on today developing test and release tooling; this role could be an opportunity for you to step-up in your career and to lead a small team for the first time, whilst continuing to remain hands on in the detail – however we would be looking for you to demonstrate that you are ready for such a move.

 

The role requires someone who is flexible, able to respond to a dynamic business environment and able to take ownership and responsibility for the delivery deadlines. The candidate should possess good analytical skills, good software engineering skills, a logical approach to problem solving, be able to work in a fast paced environment liaising with demanding stakeholders to understand complex requirements, have experience in complex data domains and be able to prioritise under pressure with minimal supervision.

 

Skills Required

- Minimum 2:1 Bachelor’s degree in a core STEM subject

- Experience leading and managing a small team

- A thorough understanding of the software development lifecycle

- Experience with end to end testing, test concepts, test automation and best practice

- Strong Unix / Linux knowledge, with Shell scripting (Perl or Python useful)

And why do we do it? Well, we make no secret of the fact, we want to become the most recommended brand, by our people and our customers. A massive part of that journey is about how we ensure that our brilliant people have a working environment in which they can truly belong and thrive.

What's in it for you?

All work and no play just isn't our style! We're already planning our future ways of working, for when life becomes a little more normal again. We're constantly evolving our approach to enable you to find a great work life balance.

If you go on to be successful in your application, some of the many benefits include:


25 days' annual leave, plus UK bank holidays.

Your birthday off every year, to treat yourself.

﻿

Having delivered some of the biggest and first dynamics cloud transformation projects on a global scale, they have a long-standing reputation of successful project delivery which has contributed to their growth.

As a business, they have grown consistently for the past 5 years and are now up to 550 employees in Europe and 300 in the UK.

We’re currently looking for Backend Engineers to join our Platform team. We’re looking for engineers who have experience working with platforms as well as writing software - you’re as comfortable writing code to solve problems as you are operating AWS or Kubernetes.

If you’re a software engineer who has some good cloud infrastructure experience already, or you’re eager to get really familiar with systems, tooling and libraries, this could be the role for you.




At Strike, you will get to work with a lot of exciting new technology

AWS for most of our infrastructure
Terraform to deliver infrastructure as code
GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

On the Platform Team, you will

Support services before they go live through activities such as system design consulting, developing software platforms and frameworks, capacity planning, and launch reviews
Maintain services once they are live by measuring and monitoring availability, latency, and overall system health
Scale systems sustainably through mechanisms like automation; evolve systems by pushing for changes that improve reliability and velocity
Practice sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems




You should apply if you have

Fluency in one or more programming languages and are able to write clean and effective code
The ability to build reliable and well-tested infrastructure on top of cloud computing systems
Experience in designing, analysing, and troubleshooting distributed systems
Knowledge of Unix fundamentals




It's useful, but not essential to have

Experience managing Kubernetes environments
Experience with relational databases and other stores, especially around optimising their performance




More reasons to join us

We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.
The COVID-19 pandemic has seen everybody at Strike shift to remote working and this is something we’ll continue to do into 2021. However, as things return to normal you may be required to work the occasional day at our modern office in Colchester, Essex (located within 10 minutes walk of Colchester mainline train station). However, if you would prefer to work from the office, then this is also an option.

What is DevOps?

DevOps is an environment, a philosophical mindset and a real-world framework that's taken business ecosystems by a storm. That doesn't mean much though, does it, let's see if we can describe it better...

Just as the title says, it brings together development and operations so that organisations can create stable, repeatable platforms for product deployment.

To become a DevOps specialist you need to have both technical and soft skills to seamlessly integrate with multiple teams. Engineers use tools to deploy infrastructure as code, create automation and test the platform during deployment and hook in monitoring systems for rapid up to date reporting; commitment to communication bridges it all together and breaks down team silos. By creating a DevOps culture, businesses deliver systems faster, cheaper and without sacrificing high quality by working in-line with agile methodology and pushing it to the limits to manage the entire lifecycle of software.

Don't worry, you're not expected to know how to do all of this already, that's where we come in.

We can take your already outstanding skillsets and train you much further to the level of a specialist consultant.

We want to help you grow into someone that can use niche skillsets from Continuous Delivery to Cloud Platforms and everything in between. By training in one of our world class academies we will make you a specialist consultant who will then work with our clients to help them realise their business needs.

Why work for us?

We take time and care to develop your abilities and confidence, your success is our success - together we make other businesses stronger.
